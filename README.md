## A Simple Self-service Application for Passengers at an Airport 

**An Introduction about the Application**:

- *Main Functionality*

The main function of this application is to provide booking and check-in services for passengers at an airport.
These services include: plane ticket booking, choosing seats, baggage check-ins, payment and printing 
boarding pass and itinerary(confirmation).
 

- *User Group*

This application is designed for passengers who either booked a ticket online in advance or have not 
done so.


- *Design Motivation*

Due to pandemic, it has been a long time since last time I traveled by plane. Kinda miss the feeling...
So why not creating an app to pretend that I can book a flight to wherever whenever I want and get ready 
for the journey. It seems fun...
